30MFF Website

This projects aims to create a website for the presentation of my portfolio. This will primarily include projects from my Communications Lab course taken in Fall 2020 at NYUAD. I will also be including any other artistic work or scientific communication ventures I have worked on.

I wanted the overall look of the website to be simplistic and easy to navigate and I then developed the aesthetics and interactivity to compliment it. The colour palette consists largely of black and white with splashes of violet and dark red as compliments or "highlights" on screen. I wanted to add interactivity in the home page by having the images present in a slide show manner whenever the mouse is hovered over them. Primarily, it is to show the kinds of work I have been doing so that the user can have a clear idea of my interests and whether they share them. But I also did not want everything to be immediately visible so that they spend some time on the website exploring and (hopefully) becoming more interested. 

I have used HTML, CSS and Javascript to build the website. I started the process by making a very rough sketch of the layout using Xd in which I decided what content to put on each page and how to link it together. Then I coded the html and css for the main page to experiment with the color schemes and positioning of content. I found it easier to experiment on the home page for aesthetic since it had less "fixed" content and I had more space on the screen to play around with and because this would be the first impression for aesthetics for the user. The video page was designed to highlight the video with artists and related pictures on the side that were kept small so as not to distract from the "product". I also made it so that the title of the next potential video peeks slightly above the fold so that the user is aware there are more videos, which can be accessed through the nav bar. The about me page was kept extremely simple with my contact info and a few lines of introduction since I did not want to influence too generally how the user perceived my work.
