30MFF Website

This projects aims to create a website for the presentation of my portfolio. This will primarily include projects from my Communications Lab course taken in Fall 2020 at NYUAD. I will also be including any other artistic work or scientific communication ventures I have worked on.

I wanted the overall look of the website to be simplistic and easy to navigate and I then developed the aesthetics and interactivity to compliment it. The colour palette consists largely of black and white with splashes of violet and dark red as compliments or "highlights" on screen. I used my own digital art for the home screen even though it did not have the most refined look and I added behind the scenes pictures on the video page. I felt that it complimented our 30MFF video which felt very "made at home". I wanted to give the website a more organic, fun look rather than an entirely polished one.

I have used HTML, CSS and Javascript to build the website. I started the process by making a very rough sketch of the layout using Xd in which I decided what content to put on each page and how to link it together. Then I coded the html and css for the main page to experiment with the color schemes and positioning of content. I found it easier to experiment on the home page for aesthetics since it had less content and I had more space on the screen to play around with, and because this would be the first impression for aesthetics for the user. The contact page was kept extremely simple with my contact information drawing the most attention and I want to add only a few lines of introduction since I do not want to influence too generally how the user perceived my work.

The video page was designed to highlight the video which was about three people dealing with wearing masks during the COVID-19 epidemic in their individual way. It was a very social media style video and so I felt that the users should have immediate access to the artists to have a better insight into their viewpoints and styles. Therefore, I decided to keep the artist pictures fairly big and I intend to link to the artists' webpages from their images later. Still, all content besides the video was kept smaller and moved below the video on window rescaling so as not to distract from the "main product". I added interactivity using javascript in the video page by having the bts images present in a slide show manner whenever the buttons are clicked. Currently, I only have two pictures but I want to expand the gallery. This is because I want the video to have more context and create a famililarity with the user but also because I do not want everything to be immediately visible so that they spend some time on the website exploring and (hopefully) becoming more interested. 

I think that deciding the layout would have been a lot more productive for me with a bit more understanding of how css positioning works since then I could better set up the divisions and classes in html to correspond with it initially and used more of my time on the aesthetics rather than positioning. The general color scheme of the website looks how I wanted it to and I feel that I'll be able to compliment the presentation my future projects with it well also. However, I do feel like I did not entirely capture the fun aspect I wanted in the website because I had intended to do a lot of that using javascript interactivity but did not have time to.
